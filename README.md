# tensorflow-demo
Tensorflow demo project.

# Running in Docker container

To run this application in its Docker container it is first necessary to create its Docker image:
```
$ docker build -t tf-demo .
```
To launch td-demo container:
```
$ docker run -it --rm --name tf-demo tf-demo
```
# Running the application on native Ubuntu (dev machine)

The recommended way is to run it in virtual environment, just as it's recommended to install TensorFlow in it.
Once you clone this repository, install virtual environment for this project as it's described here: [Install TensorFlow with pip](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

To upgrade pip3 use:
```
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

After installing virtual environment, there shall be `venv` directory in the root of the project.

Activate virtul environment wth:
```
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install all dependencies:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Unlike `venv` directory, `requirements.txt` is added to source control and it can be generated by doing the following:
```
$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
```
$ python3 src/tf-demo.py
```

Deactivate virtual environment:
```
$ deactivate
```


# Running in virtualenv

In order to run this script in virtualenv, activate virtualenv first:
```
../tensorflow/venv/tf-py3/bin$ source activate
```
Then run the script:
```
(tf-py3) ../tensorflow/venv/tf-py3/bin$ python ../../../demo-verify-tf-install/main.py 
```
Output shall be like this:
```
